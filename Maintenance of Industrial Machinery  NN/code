The model is trained on a historical dataset split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. We employ a time-based cross-validation strategy to account for the temporal nature of the data. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics, focusing on its ability to predict failures within the defined future time window accurately.
